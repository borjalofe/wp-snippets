# WP Snippets

I've created this repo to publish all the snippets I develop for WordPress websites, so anyone that needs it can use them.

## Technologies

The snippets in this repo are developed with:

![HTML5](https://github.com/borjalofe/borjalofe/blob/main/images/html5_22x22.png)
![JavaScript](https://github.com/borjalofe/borjalofe/blob/main/images/javascript_22x22.png)
![PHP](https://github.com/borjalofe/borjalofe/blob/main/images/php_22x22.png)

CSS is on your side.

## How to use a snippet

Generally, you just need to copy the code at the "Use this code" section and paste it on the `functions.php` file of your theme.

If there's any exception, I'll say it in the snippet's page.

## Status

The snippets work fine with WordPress 5.8.
